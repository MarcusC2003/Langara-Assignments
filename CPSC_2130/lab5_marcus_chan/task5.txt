both images seem simlar
-->my filtered image looks a bit more rough
--> pixels look a bit smoother

-->to make my filter better, I could add a function to my algorithm
that reduce the euclidean distance between a pixel and its neighboring
pixels if the pixels euclidean distance is over a certain threshold.

ex. if the threshold is 200 and rgb1 = 200 , rgb2 = 500 --> rgb2s value will equally reduce/increase
 all of its rgb values to get a smoother transition between the 2 pixels
